  push:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Flutter SDK
        uses: flutter-actions/setup-flutter@v4
        with:
          channel: stable
          version: 3.0.2

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: flutter pub get

      - name: Analyze project source
        run: dart analyze

      - name: Run tests
        run: flutter test
```

## Automated publishing of packages to [Pub.dev]

You can automated publishing of packages to [Pub.dev] from GitHub Actions by using the [flutter-actions/setup-pubdev-credentials] action.

```yml
# Setup Flutter SDK and automated pub.dev credentials
- uses: flutter-actions/setup-flutter@v3
- uses: flutter-actions/setup-pubdev-credentials@v1
```

## Automated job matrix across multiple version of Flutter SDK

You can automated job matrix across multiple version of **Flutter SDK** by using [flutter-actions/pubspec-matrix-action] action. This GitHub Action generates a matrix of **Dart** and **Flutter SDK** versions from a `pubspec.yaml` file.

## Troubleshooting

### Apple Silicon

If you are running this on `self-hosted` runner specially with Apple Silicon Mac only Flutter SDK v3.0.0 or later are supported.

For more information plase check https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos.

### Flutter uses Google Analytics

Starting from `flutter-actions/setup-flutter@v3`, the action will disable **Flutter SDK** built-in **Google Analytics** by default.

```bash
# Usage:
#     curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flutter-actions/setup-flutter/main/install.sh | bash -s -- <version> <channel>
# 
# Example:

export SETUP_FLUTTER_BRANCH=main
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flutter-actions/setup-flutter/${SETUP_FLUTTER_BRANCH}/install.sh | bash -s -- 3.0.2 stable
```

## Alternatives
